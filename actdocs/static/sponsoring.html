<h2>The Workshop</h2>
<p>LPW is a single day event, with multiple tracks of technical talks and a range of tutorials and training sessions, aimed at both beginner and experienced developers.</p>
<p>We anticipate over 100 attendees, and while most are from the UK, we also get developers from across Europe and beyond. The UK is recognised as having an active and vibrant Perl community and the LPW is a key event on its calendar.</p>
<p>This year LPW is being held on Saturday 24th November at the University of Westminster in London.</p>
